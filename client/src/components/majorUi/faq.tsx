  // {
  //   question: "What kind of projects do you take on?",
  //   answer:
  //     "We specialize in full-stack web development â€” from landing pages and SaaS platforms to custom dashboards and e-commerce applications."
  // },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the scope. Simple websites take 1â€“2 weeks, while larger platforms may take 3â€“6 weeks with active collaboration."
  },
  // {
  //   question: "Do you offer fixed pricing or hourly billing?",
  //   answer:
  //     "We usually work on fixed-price contracts for clarity, but we also offer hourly or retainer-based billing for long-term collaborations."
  // },
  {
    question: "Will you handle hosting, domain, and deployment?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We handle everything end-to-end â€” including domain setup, server configuration, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or your choice)."
  },
  // {
  //   question: "Will I be able to update the site myself later?",
  //   answer:
  //     "Absolutely. We build with scalability in mind. Youâ€™ll get a clean admin panel (if needed) or editable CMS integration (like Sanity or Strapi)."
  // },
  {
    question: "What if I need support after launch?",
    answer:
      "We provide post-launch support packages as well as on-demand help. Youâ€™ll never be left hanging â€” weâ€™re always just a message away."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with international clients?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we work with clients from all over the world and adjust communication to your preferred timezone and language."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer competitive pricing for startups?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we understand budget constraints. We offer special pricing for early-stage startups and solo founders without compromising on quality. Projects can start as low as â‚¹15,000."
  },
  // {
  //   question: "What technologies do you use most often?",
  //   answer:
  //     "We use modern, scalable stacks like React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, and deploy on platforms like Vercel or Netlify."
  // },
  {
    question: "How many design or feature revisions are included?",
    answer:
      "We include 2â€“3 rounds of revisions by default. We aim to get things right from the start, but you're free to request more with add-on support."
  },
  {
    question: "Who owns the code after delivery?",
    answer:
      "You do. Once the project is complete and paid for, full rights and access to the codebase, designs, and assets are handed over to you."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you communicate during a project?",
    answer:
      "We typically use WhatsApp, Email, or Slack for async updates, and Google Meet or Zoom for calls. Daily or weekly updates â€” whichever you prefer."
  },

    question: "Can you give examples of project types and their pricing?",

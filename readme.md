// TO RUN THE PROJECT 

1. Open terminals for admin, client or server
2. Use npm run (followed by folder name). ex - npm run client (for the client).
3. Alternatively use npm scripts extension (enable from explorer menu).
4. Other scripts will be added as the project grows to completely automate this process.
